## Level System

The level system works by making you get XP for the more you play and the more quests you complete.

The money allows you to buy upgrades to get XP faster.

You can reset your levels anytime by going to the config.

**Note:** Please be honest and dont give yourself infinite levels (even though I know you will).

## Health System

When you die from either fall damage or not drinking/eating enough your levels will be reset (You can turn off the health system at anytime in the config).
